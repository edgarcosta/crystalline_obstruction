crystalline_obstruction (version 0.1):

  This package computes an approximation the crystalline obstruction map
  on its space of Tate classes.  This gives rigorous upper bounds on the
  middle geometric Picard number of a given projective hypersurface or
  the geometric Picard number of Jacobian variety.
